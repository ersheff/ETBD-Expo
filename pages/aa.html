  <h2>Through Our Eyes</h2>
  <h3 class="multi-name">Kaleb Amirpour, Reese Hausman, Brandon Rengering, Garland Weaver</h3>
  <p>Through Our Eyes is a VR experience exploring the diversity inherent in the human condition as players experience a
    day in the life of four friends from wildly different backgrounds, aided by eye tracking and other methods of
    interaction in the VR space. In this demo version, players look through the eyes of Jean and Gert as they prepare
    for the group's quarterly “tune trade”. Players will gain insights into the identities of these characters, and see
    how even small and mundane daily experiences can be completely changed through different eyes.</p>
